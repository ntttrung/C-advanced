# Bus Map ver 1

## Description
* Hanoi Bus Map using **undirected graph** (weight = 1) and **JRB library**
* **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find shortest path
* **Greedy Algorithm** to generate bus suggestion from given path

## APIs
0. Find ID of a location
1. Find location through an ID
2. Check connection between 2 locations
3. Adjacent locations
4. Shortest path between 2 locations 
5. Show all buses through a location
6. Show all locations of a bus
7. Show busmap connections
8. Show buses through all locations
9. Exit

## How to compile?
Simply run `./runmap.sh`
